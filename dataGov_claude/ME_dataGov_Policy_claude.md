## Purpose and Scope

### Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines and standards for the governance of data within our local government entity, with specific focus on the use of internal data for software applications and generative AI tools while safeguarding constituent privacy and complying with relevant laws and regulations.

### Scope
This policy applies to:
- All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors with access to government data
- All data collected, stored, processed, or transmitted by or on behalf of our local government entity
- All software applications, systems, and generative AI tools that interact with government data
- All constituent data under our stewardship

## Definitions

- **Data Governance**: The overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used within our organization
- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: Any information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a specific individual
- **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Health information covered under HIPAA regulations
- **Generative AI**: Artificial intelligence systems capable of generating content, including text, images, code, or other media
- **Data Steward**: Individual responsible for maintaining data quality and implementing data governance policies
- **Data Custodian**: Individual responsible for the safe storage, transport, and processing of data
- **Data Subject**: An individual (constituent) whose personal data is being collected, processed, or stored
- **Anonymization**: Process of removing personal identifiers from data sets so individuals cannot be identified
- **Pseudonymization**: Replacing personally identifiable information with artificial identifiers

## Data Classification

All government data shall be classified into one of the following categories:

### 1. Public Data
- Information that is publicly available or intended for public disclosure
- No restrictions on access, though integrity controls may be required
- Examples: Public meeting minutes, public budget documents, published reports

### 2. Internal Data
- Information intended for use within the government entity but not highly sensitive
- Access limited to authorized personnel on a business need-to-know basis
- Examples: Internal memos, non-sensitive planning documents, operational statistics

### 3. Confidential Data
- Sensitive information where unauthorized disclosure could harm individuals or government operations
- Strict access controls required with logging and monitoring
- Examples: Detailed infrastructure plans, security protocols, non-public investigations

### 4. Restricted Data
- Highly sensitive information subject to legal protections or where disclosure could result in significant harm
- Maximum protection required with strictly enforced access limitations
- Examples: Constituent PII, PHI, financial account details, law enforcement sensitive information

## Data Access and Use

### Access Control
1. Access to data shall be granted on a least-privilege, need-to-know basis
2. Role-based access controls shall be implemented for all systems
3. Access privileges shall be reviewed quarterly
4. Multi-factor authentication is required for access to confidential and restricted data
5. Access termination procedures must be followed when employees depart

### Data Sharing
1. Internal data sharing requires documented approval from data stewards
2. External data sharing requires legal review and appropriate agreements
3. Data shared with third parties must be governed by contractual protections
4. Data sharing with other government entities must comply with relevant intergovernmental agreements

### Data Retention
1. Data shall be retained only as long as necessary for its intended purpose or as required by law
2. Retention schedules must comply with Maine state recordkeeping requirements
3. Data deletion must be secure and documented when retention periods expire

## Generative AI and Advanced Analytics

### AI System Approval Process
1. All generative AI tools must be evaluated and approved before deployment
2. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) are required for any AI system processing constituent data
3. AI systems must be tested for bias, fairness, and accuracy before implementation

### Data Usage Limitations
1. Only classified Public and Internal data may be used for general AI training
2. Confidential and Restricted data may only be used in AI systems with specific controls:
   - Data must be anonymized or pseudonymized when possible
   - Processing must occur within secure environments
   - Outputs must be reviewed to prevent re-identification
   - Usage must be legally reviewed and documented

### AI Output Controls
1. AI systems must be configured to prevent generation of sensitive information
2. Human review is required for AI-generated content intended for public release
3. AI systems must maintain audit logs of all data accessed and generated content

### Ethical AI Usage
1. AI systems must be designed to avoid discriminatory outcomes
2. Regular auditing for bias and fairness is required
3. Transparency about AI use must be maintained with constituents
4. Clear attribution of AI-generated content is required
