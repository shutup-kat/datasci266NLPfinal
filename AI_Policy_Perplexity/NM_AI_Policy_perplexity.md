INTERNAL AI POLICY  
NEW MEXICO LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITY

**1\. Purpose**  
This policy establishes ethical, legal, and operational standards for the responsible development, procurement, and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, including generative AI and large language models (LLMs), by \[Government Entity Name\]. It ensures compliance with federal, state, and local regulations while prioritizing fairness, transparency, accountability, and public trust in AI-driven decision-making processes affecting approximately 8 million constituents.

## **2\. Scope**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors engaged in designing, implementing, or using AI tools for government operations. This includes AI systems developed in-house, procured as-a-service (AIaaS), or integrated into public-facing services.

## **3\. Definitions**

* AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS): Third-party AI tools accessed via cloud platforms (e.g., generative AI chatbots, predictive analytics APIs).  
* High-Risk AI: Systems whose outputs directly impact constituent rights, safety, or access to essential services (e.g., healthcare eligibility determinations, law enforcement risk assessments).  
* Algorithmic Bias: Systemic errors in AI outputs that create unfair advantages or disadvantages for specific demographic groups.

## **4\. Core Ethical Principles**

4.1 Bias Mitigation and Fairness  
All AI systems must undergo rigorous pre-deployment bias audits using datasets that reflect New Mexico’s demographic diversity, including age, ethnicity, income level, and rural/urban representation. The IT Department will utilize standardized fairness assessment tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 to evaluate algorithmic outputs for disproportionate impacts. As defined in Section 3, high-risk AI systems require additional quarterly reviews by the AI Ethics Advisory Board, a cross-functional team comprising ethicists, legal counsel, and community representatives.  
4.2 Transparency and Explainability  
The government entity will publish an annual *Public AI Transparency Report* detailing the types of AI deployed, their intended purposes, data sources, accuracy rates, and bias mitigation measures. For all AI-driven decisions affecting constituent rights or benefits, staff must maintain human oversight and provide plain-language explanations of how the system reached its conclusion.  
4.3 Legal and Regulatory Compliance  
AI systems shall comply with federal mandates (e.g., NIST AI Risk Management Framework, Executive Order 14110), New Mexico statutes (e.g., H.B. 60 – Artificial Intelligence Accountability Act), and local data governance ordinances. Use of AI in ways that violate the Civil Rights Act, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), or New Mexico Human Rights Act is expressly prohibited.

## **5\. AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) Governance**

5.1 Procurement Requirements  
Prior to acquiring any AIaaS tool, departments must:

1. Conduct a vendor risk assessment verifying compliance with NIST SP 800-171 security standards.  
2. Require vendors to disclose training data sources, bias testing methodologies, and model accuracy rates.  
3. Obtain written approval from the IT Security Office and Legal Department.

5.2 Usage Restrictions  
Employees are prohibited from:

* Inputting sensitive constituent data (e.g., Social Security numbers, medical records) into public LLM interfaces.  
* Using AI for automated decisions in high-risk domains without explicit approval from the AI Ethics Advisory Board.  
* Deploying facial recognition technologies in public spaces without Governing Council authorization.

## **6\. Risk Management Protocols**

6.1 Auditing and Monitoring  
The AI Governance Team will conduct quarterly audits of all operational AI systems using the Aequitas audit toolkit to detect discriminatory patterns. Audit results will be documented in a centralized registry accessible to department heads and the Chief AI Officer. Real-time monitoring via tools like Splunk will flag anomalous outputs for immediate review.  
6.2 Incident Response  
A tiered response protocol is established:

* Level 1 (Minor): Logged incidents (e.g., minor inaccuracies) require resolution within 5 business days.  
* Level 3 (Severe): Systemic bias or security breaches mandate system suspension, public notification within 24 hours, and formal reporting to the New Mexico Attorney General.

## **7\. Data Privacy and Security**

All data processed by AI systems must be encrypted using AES-256 standards. Training datasets containing constituent information shall be stored exclusively on government-secured servers with role-based access controls. Third-party AIaaS providers must sign data processing agreements confirming compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and New Mexico Data Privacy Act.

## **8\. Staff Training and Accountability**

8.1 Mandatory Training Programs

* Non-Technical Staff: Annual 2-hour training on AI ethics, recognizing algorithmic bias, and proper incident reporting procedures.  
* Technical Teams: Biannual certification in model interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME) and bias mitigation strategies.

8.2 Incident Reporting  
Employees must immediately report suspected AI-related errors or harms through the centralized \[AI Incident Portal\]. The AI Governance Team will investigate root causes within 10 business days and publish anonymized findings internally to inform system improvements.  
8.3 Oversight Roles

* Chief AI Officer: Responsible for policy enforcement, regulator coordination, and annual compliance reporting.  
* AI Ethics Advisory Board: Reviews high-risk use cases and approves mitigation plans for identified biases.

## **9\. Policy Review and Updates**

This policy will be reviewed biannually by the AI Governance Team and updated to reflect advancements in AI governance frameworks (e.g., EU AI Act) or changes to state/federal regulations. Major revisions require public consultation through town hall meetings and a 30-day comment period prior to implementation.  
Enforcement  
Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination, per \[Government Entity Name\]’s HR Code §201.5. Contractors found non-compliant face contract termination and financial penalties.
