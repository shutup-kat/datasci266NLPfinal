INTERNAL AI POLICY  
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
Effective Date: March 25, 2025 | Approved By: Massachusetts AI Strategic Task Force

## **1\. Purpose**

This policy establishes ethical, legal, and operational standards for the responsible development, procurement, and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems by Massachusetts state agencies. It ensures compliance with state laws, including the Massachusetts Artificial Intelligence Accountability and Consumer Protection Act (MA AIACPA), while prioritizing transparency, equity, and accountability in AI-driven processes affecting Massachusetts' 7 million residents.

## **2\. Scope**

This policy applies to all state employees, contractors, and third-party vendors engaged in the design, implementation, or use of AI tools for government operations. This includes AI systems developed in-house, procured as-a-service (AIaaS), or integrated into public-facing services.

## **3\. Definitions**

* Artificial Intelligence (AI): Any machine-based system that for an explicit or implicit objective infers from the inputs the system receives how to generate outputs, including content, decisions, predictions or recommendations, that can influence physical or virtual environments[1](https://www.mma.org/executive-order-establishes-ai-strategic-task-force/).  
* High-Risk AI System: Any AI system that when deployed makes or is a substantial factor in making a consequential decision affecting education, employment, financial services, healthcare, housing, insurance, or legal services[7](https://natlawreview.com/article/states-ring-new-year-proposed-ai-legislation).  
* Algorithmic Discrimination: Any condition in which the use of an AI system results in unlawful differential treatment or impact that disfavors a person based on protected characteristics.

## **4\. Governance Structures**

4.1 Massachusetts AI Strategic Task Force  
Established by Executive Order on February 14, 2024, the Task Force oversees ethical AI implementation and reviews high-risk systems quarterly. Members include representatives from key state departments, higher education, and industry experts[1](https://www.mma.org/executive-order-establishes-ai-strategic-task-force/).  
4.2 Massachusetts AI Hub  
Housed within the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative (MassTech), this entity operationalizes Task Force directives and maintains Massachusetts' Public AI Inventory[3](https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-healey-announces-massachusetts-ai-hub-to-make-state-global-leader-in-applied-ai-innovation).

## **5\. Core Ethical Principles**

5.1 Human-Centered Design  
AI systems must augment, not replace, human judgment in critical decision-making processes affecting citizens' rights or benefits.  
5.2 Transparency and Public Trust

* Publish annual transparency reports detailing AI system purposes, accuracy rates, bias audits, and incident resolutions.  
* Maintain a public AI inventory cataloging active AI tools used across state agencies.

5.3 Bias Mitigation and Fairness  
Conduct pre-deployment audits using standardized fairness assessment tools for all AI systems, with particular attention to those affecting protected classes.

## **6\. AI Procurement and Use**

6.1 Approved Tools and Restrictions

* Generative AI: Permitted for research and document drafting but prohibited for final decision outputs affecting constituent rights or benefits.  
* Facial Recognition: Use in public spaces requires explicit approval from the AI Strategic Task Force and must comply with strict privacy safeguards.

6.2 Data Protection and Privacy

* Prohibit input of non-public data into public AI tools or LLMs.  
* Encrypt all AI-processed data using AES-256 standards and store on state-secured servers compliant with Massachusetts' data privacy laws.

## **7\. Risk Management and Auditing**

7.1 Regular Audits  
Conduct biannual audits of all operational AI systems to detect discriminatory patterns or unintended consequences. Results will be reviewed by the AI Strategic Task Force and published in redacted form.  
7.2 Incident Response Protocol

* Level 1 (Minor): Issues logged in the centralized AI Incident Portal and resolved within 10 business days.  
* Level 3 (Severe): Immediate system suspension, public notification within 24 hours, and formal reporting to the Massachusetts Legislature.

## **8\. Training and Compliance**

8.1 Mandatory Training Programs

* All state employees complete annual 3-hour modules on AI ethics, bias recognition, and incident reporting procedures.  
* Technical staff certify in model interpretability techniques through partnerships with Massachusetts universities.

8.2 Whistleblower Protections  
Employees reporting potential violations or ethical concerns are protected under Massachusetts' whistleblower protection laws.

## **9\. Policy Review and Updates**

This policy will be reviewed annually by the AI Strategic Task Force, incorporating public feedback through town halls and a 30-day comment period. Updates will reflect advancements in AI governance frameworks and changes to state or federal regulations.  
Enforcement  
Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action for state employees, up to and including termination, as per Massachusetts State Personnel Rules. Contractors or vendors found non-compliant may face contract termination and potential legal action.
