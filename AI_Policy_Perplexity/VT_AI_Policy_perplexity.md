INTERNAL AI POLICY  
STATE OF VERMONT  
Effective Date: March 25, 2025 | Approved By: Vermont AI Council

## **1\. Purpose**

This policy establishes ethical, legal, and operational standards for the responsible development, procurement, and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems by Vermont state agencies. It ensures compliance with state laws, including Act 137 (2020) and Act 132 (2022), as well as federal mandates, while prioritizing transparency, equity, and accountability in AI-driven processes affecting Vermont's 3 million residents.

## **2\. Scope**

This policy applies to all state employees, contractors, and third-party vendors engaged in the design, implementation, or use of AI tools for government operations. This includes AI systems developed in-house, procured as-a-service (AIaaS), or integrated into public-facing services.

## **3\. Definitions**

* Artificial Intelligence (AI): Machine-based systems that can, for human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments[8](https://www.oregon.gov/eis/Documents/Presentation%20by%20Chief%20Data%20and%20AI%20Officer%20of%20Vermont.pdf).  
* Automated Decision Systems (ADS): Any software, system, or process that aims to automate, assist, or replace human decision-making[5](https://digitalservices.vermont.gov/document/automated-decision-systemartificial-intelligence-ai-use-data-management-policy).  
* Generative AI: AI systems capable of generating new content, including text, images, or other data types.

## **4\. Governance Structures**

4.1 Council on Artificial Intelligence  
Co-chaired by the Executive Director of Racial Equity and the State Chief Technology Officer, this body oversees ethical AI implementation and reviews high-risk systems quarterly. Members include representatives from the ACLU of Vermont, Department of Public Safety, and academic experts from Norwich University[1](https://extanto.com/articles/vermonts-ai-policy-informs-user-guide-for-responsible-ai-implementation/).  
4.2 Division of Artificial Intelligence  
Housed within the Vermont Digital Services Agency, this division operationalizes Council directives and maintains Vermont's Public AI Inventory, cataloging active AI tools used across state agencies[1](https://extanto.com/articles/vermonts-ai-policy-informs-user-guide-for-responsible-ai-implementation/).

## **5\. Core Ethical Principles**

5.1 Human-Centered Design  
AI systems must augment, not replace, human judgment. All ADS impacting rights or benefits require human review before implementation, in accordance with Vermont's Code of Ethics[6](https://digitalservices.vermont.gov/document/artificial-intelligence-code-ethics).  
5.2 Transparency and Public Trust

* Publish annual transparency reports detailing AI system purposes, accuracy rates, bias audits, and incident resolutions.  
* Disclose AI use in political advertisements within 90 days of elections, as per 2025 Senate Bill S.189[1](https://extanto.com/articles/vermonts-ai-policy-informs-user-guide-for-responsible-ai-implementation/).

5.3 Bias Mitigation and Fairness  
Conduct pre-deployment audits using standardized fairness assessment tools for all AI systems, with particular attention to those affecting protected classes. The Agency of Digital Services will validate datasets against Vermont's rural/urban demographic distribution to ensure representativeness[1](https://extanto.com/articles/vermonts-ai-policy-informs-user-guide-for-responsible-ai-implementation/).

## **6\. AI Procurement and Use**

6.1 Approved Tools and Restrictions

* Generative AI: Permitted for research and document drafting but prohibited for final decision outputs affecting constituent rights or benefits[7](https://support.vsc.edu/ai-policy/).  
* Facial Recognition: Banned in public spaces under VT SB 124 (2019), except for exigent law enforcement emergencies approved by the Attorney General[4](https://www.multistate.ai/ai-policy-overview-vermont).

6.2 Data Protection and Privacy

* Prohibit input of non-public data (e.g., personally identifiable information, health records) into public AI tools or LLMs[2](https://support.vsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AI-Policy.pdf).  
* Encrypt all AI-processed data using AES-256 standards and store on state-secured servers compliant with the Vermont Data Privacy Act.

## **7\. Risk Management and Auditing**

7.1 Regular Audits  
Conduct biannual audits of all operational AI systems to detect discriminatory patterns or unintended consequences. Results will be reviewed by the AI Council and published in redacted form to ensure public transparency[1](https://extanto.com/articles/vermonts-ai-policy-informs-user-guide-for-responsible-ai-implementation/).  
7.2 Incident Response Protocol

* Level 1 (Minor): Issues logged in the centralized AI Incident Portal and resolved within 10 business days.  
* Level 3 (Severe): Immediate system suspension, public notification within 24 hours, and formal reporting to the Vermont Legislature.

## **8\. Training and Compliance**

8.1 Mandatory Training Programs

* All state employees complete annual 3-hour modules on AI ethics, bias recognition, and incident reporting procedures.  
* Technical staff certify in model interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME) through partnerships with Norwich University[1](https://extanto.com/articles/vermonts-ai-policy-informs-user-guide-for-responsible-ai-implementation/).

8.2 Whistleblower Protections  
Employees reporting potential violations or ethical concerns are protected under Vermont's Whistleblower Protection Act.

## **9\. Policy Review and Updates**

This policy will be reviewed biennially by the AI Council, incorporating public feedback through town halls and a 45-day comment period. Updates will reflect advancements in AI governance frameworks and changes to state or federal regulations.  
Enforcement  
Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action for state employees, up to and including termination, as per Vermont Personnel Rules. Contractors or vendors found non-compliant may face contract termination and potential legal action.
