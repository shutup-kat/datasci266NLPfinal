Page 38---- Page 24 ---- NIST AI 100-1 AI RMF 1.0 Part 2: Core and Profiles 5. AI RMF Core The AI RMF Core provides outcomes and actions that enable dialogue, understanding, and activities to manage AI risks and responsibly develop trustworthy AI systems. As illus- trated in Figure 5, the Core is composed of four functions: GOVERN ,MAP ,MEASURE , and MANAGE . Each of these high-level functions is broken down into categories and sub- categories. Categories and subcategories are subdivided into specific actions and outcomes. Actions do not constitute a checklist, nor are they necessarily an ordered set of steps. Fig. 5. Functions organize AI risk management activities at their highest level to govern, map, measure, and manage AI risks. Governance is designed to be a cross-cutting function to inform and be infused throughout the other three functions. Risk management should be continuous, timely, and performed throughout the AI system lifecycle dimensions. AI RMF Core functions should be carried","Issues that merit further consideration and research include: 1.Human roles and responsibilities in decision making and overseeing AI systems need to be clearly defined and differentiated. Human-AI configurations can span from fully autonomous to fully manual. AI systems can autonomously make deci- sions, defer decision making to a human expert, or be used by a human decision maker as an additional opinion. Some AI systems may not require human oversight, such as models used to improve video compression. Other systems may specifically require human oversight. 2.Decisions that go into the design, development, deployment, evaluation, and use of AI systems reflect systemic and human cognitive biases. AI actors bring their cognitive biases, both individual and group, into the process. Biases can stem from end-user decision-making tasks and be introduced across the AI lifecycle via human assumptions, expectations, and decisions during design and modeling tasks. These biases, which are notand operations. Documentation can enhance transparency, improve human review processes, and bolster accountability in AI system teams. After putting in place the structures, systems, processes, and teams described in the GOV- ERN function, organizations should benefit from a purpose-driven culture focused on risk understanding and management. It is incumbent on Framework users to continue to ex- ecute the GOVERN function as knowledge, cultures, and needs or expectations from AI actors evolve over time. Practices related to governing AI risks are described in the NIST AI RMF Playbook. Table 1 lists the GOVERN function’s categories and subcategories.

AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy (Adapted from: OECD Recommendation on AI:2019; ISO/IEC22989:2022). While there are myriad standards and best practices to help organizations mitigate the risks of traditional software or information-based systems, the risks posed by AI systems are in many ways unique (See Appendix B). AI systems, for example, may be trained on data that can change over time, sometimes significantly and unexpectedly, affecting system function- ality and trustworthiness in ways that are hard to understand. AI systems and the contexts in which they are deployed are frequently complex, making it difficult to detect and respond to failures when they occur. AI systems are inherently socio-technical in nature, meaning they are influenced by societal dynamics and human behavior. AI risks – and benefits – can emerge from the interplay of technicaldeployment, and use of AI systems over time. AI actors are defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as “those who play an active role in the AI system lifecycle, including organiza- tions and individuals that deploy or operate AI” [OECD (2019) Artificial Intelligence in Society—OECD iLibrary] (See Appendix A). The AI RMF is intended to be practical, to adapt to the AI landscape as AI technologies continue to develop, and to be operationalized by organizations in varying degrees and capacities so society can benefit from AI while also being protected from its potential harms. The Framework and supporting resources will be updated, expanded, and improved based on evolving technology, the standards landscape around the world, and AI community ex- perience and feedback. NIST will continue to align the AI RMF and related guidance with applicable international standards, guidelines, and practices. As the AI RMF is put into use, additional lessons will be","(e.g., UX/UI design), governance experts, data engineers, data providers, system funders, product man- agers, third-party entities, evaluators, and legal and privacy governance.

mea1,"the AI lifecycle can en- hance opportunities for informing contextually sensitive evaluations, and for identifying AI system benefits and positive impacts. These practices can increase the likelihood that risks arising in social contexts are managed appropriately. Understanding and treatment of trustworthiness characteristics depends on an AI actor’s particular role within the AI lifecycle. For any given AI system, an AI designer or developer may have a different perception of the characteristics than the deployer. Trustworthiness characteristics explained in this document influence each other. Highly secure but unfair systems, accurate but opaque and uninterpretable systems, and inaccurate but secure, privacy-enhanced, and transparent systems are all unde- sirable. A comprehensive approach to risk management calls for balancing tradeoffs among the trustworthiness characteristics. It is the joint responsibility of all AI ac- tors to determine whether AI technology is an appropriate ormethods such as de-identification and aggregation for certain model outputs, can support design for privacy-enhanced AI systems. Under certain conditions such as data sparsity, privacy- enhancing techniques can result in a loss in accuracy, affecting decisions about fairness and other values in certain domains. 3.7 Fair – with Harmful Bias Managed Fairness in AI includes concerns for equality and equity by addressing issues such as harm- ful bias and discrimination. Standards of fairness can be complex and difficult to define be- cause perceptions of fairness differ among cultures and may shift depending on application. Organizations’ risk management efforts will be enhanced by recognizing and considering these differences. Systems in which harmful biases are mitigated are not necessarily fair. For example, systems in which predictions are somewhat balanced across demographic groups may still be inaccessible to individuals with disabilities or affected by the digital divide or may","experience, perform human-centered evaluation and testing, and inform impact assessments. Domain Expert tasks involve input from multidisciplinary practitioners or scholars who provide knowledge or expertise in – and about – an industry sector, economic sector, con- text, or application area where an AI system is being used. AI actors who are domain experts can provide essential guidance for AI system design and development, and inter- pret outputs in support of work performed by TEVV and AI impact assessment teams. AI Impact Assessment tasks include assessing and evaluating requirements for AI system accountability, combating harmful bias, examining impacts of AI systems, product safety, liability, and security, among others. AI actors such as impact assessors and evaluators provide technical, human factor, socio-cultural, and legal expertise.

Availability of reliable metrics: The current lack of consensus on robust and verifiable measurement methods for risk and trustworthiness, and applicability to different AI use cases, is an AI risk measurement challenge. Potential pitfalls when seeking to measure negative risk or harms include the reality that development of metrics is often an institu- tional endeavor and may inadvertently reflect factors unrelated to the underlying impact. In addition, measurement approaches can be oversimplified, gamed, lack critical nuance, be- come relied upon in unexpected ways, or fail to account for differences in affected groups and contexts. Approaches for measuring impacts on a population work best if they recognize that contexts matter, that harms may affect varied groups or sub-groups differently, and that communities or other"
